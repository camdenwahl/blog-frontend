            <h1>Welcome to Web & Wizards!</h1>
            <p>Web & Wizards is a personal blog made by me to post blogs about novel writing, storytelling, and programming adventures. I hope you find articles that you're interested in reading or learning about on this journey with me.</p>
            <p>I've been writing fictional stories since I was ten years old, honing my craft and coming up with unique stories. In this blog I will discuss my own struggles and breakthroughs while I'm writing my latest work.</p>
            <p>I've been programming since 2021 where I started in the Python programming language. I created a variety of scripts, including a Discord bot for a small community. Later on through the Odin Project I discovered my love for JavaScript and web development.</p>
